# Lp3 Imgui

This contains a tiny bit of code to ease integrating ImGUI into code using other LP3 stuff.

## Credit Notice for Red Blob Games

Much of this code is copied off of [redblobgames](https://github.com/redblobgames/imgui)'s fork of ImGui (specifically, [this file](https://github.com/redblobgames/imgui/blob/master/examples/sdl_emscripten_example/imgui_impl_sdl.cpp)) which, like ImGUI itself, is licensed under the MIT license. The fork contains code that allows ImGUI to work with OpenGL ES2 which allows it to work with EmScripten.

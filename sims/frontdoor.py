Front Door
----------

This simple module aids in the creation of "front door" scripts, which can
help organize automated scripts and reduce the need for overly verbose docs.
The idea is you can copy this file into your repository and import it from a
Python script.

A front door script generally accepts a series of options which defer to some
other process call to do work of some kind. There is an example in the Front
Door repo (located at https://github.com/TimSimpson/frontdoor) of what this
looks like, but in short, it lets common commands that you might want to tell
someone about in documentation exist in a script that people can run instead.
